By\n            contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your\n            freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure\n            it remains free software for all its users.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n            price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n            you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and\n            charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can\n            get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use\n            pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do\n            these things.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\n            with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\n            you this License which gives you legal permission to copy,\n            distribute and/or modify the software.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\n            improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\n            receive widespread use, become available for other developers to\n            incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and\n            encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of\n            software used on network servers, this result may fail to come\n            about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified\n            version and letting the public access it on a server without ever\n            releasing its source code to the public.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\n            ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes\n            available to the community. It requires the operator of a network\n            server to provide the source code of the modified version running\n            there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a\n            modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public\n            access to the source code of the modified version.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\n            published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This\n            is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero\n            has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits\n            relicensing under this license.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n            modification follow.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>\n          <h2>0.

Termination.</h2>\n          <p>\n            You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n            provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n            modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights\n            under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the\n            third paragraph of section 11).\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n            license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n            provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n            finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the\n            copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some\n            reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n            reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n            violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n            received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from\n            that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days\n            after your receipt of the notice.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n            licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you\n            under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not\n            permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses\n            for the same material under section 10.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h2>\n          <p>\n            You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n            run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n            occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n            to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\n            nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate\n            or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you\n            do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n            covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h2>\n          <p>\n            Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n            receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n            propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not\n            responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this\n            License.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring\n            control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or\n            subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If\n            propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction,\n            each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also\n            receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in\n            interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a\n            right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the\n            predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it\n            with reasonable efforts.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n            rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may\n            not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n            rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate\n            litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)\n            alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,\n            selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion\n            of it.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>11.
