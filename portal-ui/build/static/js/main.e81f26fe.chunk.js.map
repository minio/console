By\n            contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your\n            freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure\n            it remains free software for all its users.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n            price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n            you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and\n            charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can\n            get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use\n            pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do\n            these things.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\n            with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\n            you this License which gives you legal permission to copy,\n            distribute and/or modify the software.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\n            improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\n            receive widespread use, become available for other developers to\n            incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and\n            encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of\n            software used on network servers, this result may fail to come\n            about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified\n            version and letting the public access it on a server without ever\n            releasing its source code to the public.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\n            ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes\n            available to the community. It requires the operator of a network\n            server to provide the source code of the modified version running\n            there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a\n            modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public\n            access to the source code of the modified version.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\n            published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This\n            is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero\n            has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits\n            relicensing under this license.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n            modification follow.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>\n          <h2>0.

You may convey covered works to others for the sole\n            purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or\n            provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that\n            you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material\n            for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running\n            the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf,\n            under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from\n            making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their\n            relationship with you.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n            the conditions stated below.

This\n                alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,\n                and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in\n                accord with subsection 6b.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n                place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to\n                the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place\n                at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy\n                the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the\n                place to copy the object code is a network server, the\n                Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by\n                you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying\n                facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the\n                object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.\n                Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you\n                remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as\n                needed to satisfy these requirements.\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,\n                provided you inform other peers where the object code and\n                Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the\n                general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is\n            excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not\n            be included in conveying the object code work.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer\n            product&quot;, which means any tangible personal property which is\n            normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2)\n            anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In\n            determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases\n            shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product\n            received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a\n            typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the\n            status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular\n            user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A\n            product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has\n            substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such\n            uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any\n            methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information\n            required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work\n            in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding\n            Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued\n            functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or\n            interfered with solely because modification has been made.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\n            specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\n            part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of\n            the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or\n            for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is\n            characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section\n            must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this\n            requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party\n            retains the ability to install modified object code on the User\n            Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include\n            a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or\n            updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the\n            recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or\n            installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification\n            itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network\n            or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the\n            network.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information\n            provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is\n            publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the\n            public in source code form), and must require no special password or\n            key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n          </p>\n          <h2>7.

Termination.</h2>\n          <p>\n            You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n            provided under this License.

Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n            occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n            to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\n            nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate\n            or modify any covered work.

If\n            propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction,\n            each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also\n            receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in\n            interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a\n            right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the\n            predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it\n            with reasonable efforts.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n            rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may\n            not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n            rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate\n            litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)\n            alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,\n            selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion\n            of it.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>11. Patents.</h2>\n          <p>\n            A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use\n            under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is\n            based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's\n            &quot;contributor version&quot;.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            A contributor's &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent\n            claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already\n            acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some\n            manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its\n            contributor version, but do not include claims that would be\n            infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the\n            contributor version. For purposes of this definition,\n            &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses\n            in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n            patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\n            make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify\n            and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is\n            any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to\n            enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent\n            or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To\n            &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a party means to make\n            such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the\n            party.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n            and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n            to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through\n            a publicly available network server or other readily accessible\n            means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be\n            so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of\n            the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a\n            manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend\n            the patent license to downstream recipients. &quot;Knowingly\n            relying&quot; means you have actual knowledge that, but for the\n            patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or\n            your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would\n            infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you\n            have reason to believe are valid.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n            arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\n            covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n            receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,\n            modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the\n            patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients\n            of the covered work and works based on it.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not\n            include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of,\n            or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights\n            that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey\n            a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third\n            party that is in the business of distributing software, under which\n            you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your\n            activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party\n            grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work\n            from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with\n            copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from\n            those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific\n            products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you\n            entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,\n            prior to 28 March 2007.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\n            any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\n            otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h2>\n          <p>\n            If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement\n            or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they\n            do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\n            convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your\n            obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,\n            then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if\n            you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for\n            further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the\n            only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would\n            be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>\n            13.

This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding\n            Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public\n            License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n            permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n            under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\n            combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this\n            License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered\n            work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by\n            version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>14.
