By\n            contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your\n            freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure\n            it remains free software for all its users.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n            price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n            you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and\n            charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can\n            get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use\n            pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do\n            these things.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\n            with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\n            you this License which gives you legal permission to copy,\n            distribute and/or modify the software.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\n            improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\n            receive widespread use, become available for other developers to\n            incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and\n            encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of\n            software used on network servers, this result may fail to come\n            about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified\n            version and letting the public access it on a server without ever\n            releasing its source code to the public.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\n            ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes\n            available to the community. It requires the operator of a network\n            server to provide the source code of the modified version running\n            there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a\n            modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public\n            access to the source code of the modified version.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\n            published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This\n            is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero\n            has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits\n            relicensing under this license.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n            modification follow.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>\n          <h2>0.

The resulting work is called a\n            &quot;modified version&quot; of the earlier work or a work\n            &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a\n            work based on the Program.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that,\n            without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable\n            for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it\n            on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes\n            copying, distribution (with or without modification), making\n            available to the public, and in some countries other activities as\n            well.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that\n            enables other parties to make or receive copies.

If the interface presents a list of\n            user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the\n            list meets this criterion.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>1. Source Code.</h2>\n          <p>\n            The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of\n            the work for making modifications to it. &quot;Object code&quot;\n            means any non-source form of a work.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is\n            an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in\n            the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming\n            language, one that is widely used among developers working in that\n            language.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include\n            anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in\n            the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not\n            part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of\n            the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard\n            Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in\n            source code form. A &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context,\n            means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on)\n            of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable\n            work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code\n            interpreter used to run it.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form\n            means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an\n            executable work) run the object code and to modify the work,\n            including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not\n            include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or\n            generally available free programs which are used unmodified in\n            performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For\n            example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files\n            associated with source files for the work, and the source code for\n            shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is\n            specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data\n            communication or control flow between those subprograms and other\n            parts of the work.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\n            regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\n            Source.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same\n            work.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>2.

You may convey covered works to others for the sole\n            purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or\n            provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that\n            you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material\n            for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running\n            the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf,\n            under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from\n            making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their\n            relationship with you.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n            the conditions stated below.

Termination.</h2>\n          <p>\n            You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n            provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n            modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights\n            under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the\n            third paragraph of section 11).\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n            license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n            provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n            finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the\n            copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some\n            reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n            reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n            violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n            received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from\n            that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days\n            after your receipt of the notice.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n            licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you\n            under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not\n            permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses\n            for the same material under section 10.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>9.

Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n            occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n            to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\n            nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate\n            or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you\n            do not accept this License.

You are not\n            responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this\n            License.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring\n            control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or\n            subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If\n            propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction,\n            each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also\n            receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in\n            interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a\n            right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the\n            predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it\n            with reasonable efforts.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n            rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may\n            not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n            rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate\n            litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)\n            alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,\n            selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion\n            of it.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>11.

It is safest\n            to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n            state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n            the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full\n            notice is found.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            <code>\n              &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what\n              it does.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;\n              This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or\n              modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License\n              as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of\n              the License, or (at your option) any later version.
